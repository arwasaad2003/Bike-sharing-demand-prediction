Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. 
Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.
Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
Use the files (test,train) to build a machine learning regression model that make prediction on test data.
